# Improving-the-Energy-Efficiency-of-Bipedal-Walking-by-Energy-Recycling
Bipedalism is a critical step in human evolution and bipedal walking robots have been studied extensively in literature. However, the efficiency of the bipedal robots cannot be further improved due to the energy loss induced by foot-ground collision. Many papers have indicated that collisionless passive dynamic walking is the key to a more efficient bipedal walker. In this paper, an energy-recycling passive rimless spoked wheel is proposed. The rimless spoked wheel takes advantage of springs that are mounted on the legs, which can absorb the collision energy, store it in the spring (by locking the compressed spring), and then inject back into the system during the toe-off phase. In this way, energy is recycled and can enable much more efficient walking. We have conceived, designed, prototyped, and tested the collisionless bipedal walker. Our concept is based on the rimless spoked wheel which mimics biped walking since no more than two spokes are in ground contact at each time. Experiments show that it can walk down a slope of 1 degree, which achieves a cost of transport of approximately 0.02. Compared with a rimless spoked wheel without the energy recycling, which has a minimal cost of transport of 0.05 observed in the experiments, the cost of transport was reduced by 60%.![image](https://github.com/JMLIN123/Improving-the-Energy-Efficiency-of-Bipedal-Walking-by-Energy-Recycling/assets/87386322/1223631b-e339-40fc-8647-c4d8d853772e)
